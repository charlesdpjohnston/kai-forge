# Socratic Tutor V2: A Passion Project Learning System

Welcome to the Socratic Tutor! This repository is designed to be an interactive learning environment where you build a project you're passionate about, with an AI tutor (KAI) guiding you through computer science principles along the way.

## How It Works

1.  **Define Your Project:** Open `tutor_state/01_Project_Brief.md` and describe the project you want to build.
2.  **Start Your Session:** Open this project in an AI-powered IDE like Cursor. Start a chat with the agent by giving it the full context of the repository. A good starting prompt is: "Please act as KAI. Begin my lesson."
3.  **Collaborate:** KAI will read the `tutor_state/` files and begin guiding you. It will create and modify files in the `project/` directory and update the `tutor_state/` files directly to track your progress.

Happy learning!

# KAI Forge: A Passion Project Learning System

Welcome to KAI Forge! This repository is a unique, interactive learning environment designed for use with an AI-powered IDE like Cursor.

The system uses an AI tutor named KAI to teach you computer science fundamentals by helping you build a project you are truly passionate about, from the ground up.

## How It Works

1.  **Define Your Project:** Open `tutor_state/01_Project_Brief.md` and describe the project you want to build.
2.  **Start Your Session:** Open this project in your AI IDE. Start a chat with the agent by giving it the full context of the repository. A good starting prompt is: "Please act as KAI. Begin my lesson."
3.  **Collaborate & Build:** KAI will read your project brief and begin guiding you. It will write code directly into the `project/` folder and update the `tutor_state/` files to track your progress. You build, you learn, you see your passion project come to life.

Happy learning!
